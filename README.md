# I-Cant-Beleive-Its-Not-2
Userscript for Scratch 3.0.

Used to make 3.0 look like 2, because why not?

I use Tapermonkey for installing userscripts.

Install: <https://github.com/infinitytec/I-Cant-Believe-Its-Not-2/raw/master/not2.user.js>
## What will change?
A lot of it. The idea is to make 3.0 look as much like 2 as reasonably possible.
## What will stay the same?
Some 3.0 UI elements will work the exact same as in 3.0.
This includes the blocks palette and some UI buttons. I do not plan on changing these as it would require too much effort.
## Why?
For fun. And some people may want to use it.
